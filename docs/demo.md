## Two Learning Experiences

### ðŸ“Š Demo 1: Runtime Interoperability
**Human-orchestrated workflow**

Learn how agex agents work with real Python objects:

- Database integration without wrapper classes
- Agents returning live `pandas.DataFrame` objects  
- Complex data visualization with `plotly.Figure` objects
- Object passing between your code and agent environments

### ðŸ¤– Demo 2: Multi-Agent Orchestration
**Agent-orchestrated workflow**

See sophisticated agent coordination in action:

- Orchestrator agents delegating to specialist sub-agents
- Hierarchical agent workflows with natural Python control flow
- Complete event introspection and debugging capabilities
- Time-travel debugging with execution history

## How It Works

These demos use:

- **JupyterLite**: Full Python environment running in your browser via WebAssembly
- **Dummy LLM**: Pre-recorded responses for instant, reproducible execution
- **Real agex**: Complete framework capabilities without compromises

!!! info "About the Responses"
    The LLM responses in these demos are real outputs captured from actual model interactions, ensuring authentic examples while providing reproducible results.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of these demos, you'll understand:

1. **Why runtime interoperability matters** - See the difference between JSON tools and real object passing
2. **How to build multi-agent systems** - Learn orchestration patterns that scale
3. **How to debug agent behavior** - Use the events system for complete visibility
4. **When to choose agex** - Understand the framework's strengths and use cases
