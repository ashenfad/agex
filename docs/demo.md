# Notebook Demos

Explore agex through complete, runnable examples that demonstrate core capabilities with real code, outputs, and explanations.

## Featured Demonstrations

### ðŸ“Š [Runtime Interoperability](demos/runtime-interoperability.ipynb)
**Human-orchestrated workflow**

Learn how agex agents work with real Python objects:

- Database integration without wrapper classes
- Agents returning live `pandas.DataFrame` objects  
- Complex data visualization with `plotly.Figure` objects
- Object passing between your code and agent environments

### ðŸ¤– Multi-Agent Orchestration
**Agent-orchestrated workflow** *(Coming soon)*

See sophisticated agent coordination in action:

- Orchestrator agents delegating to specialist sub-agents
- Hierarchical agent workflows with natural Python control flow
- Complete event introspection and debugging capabilities
- Time-travel debugging with execution history

## About These Demos

These demonstrations use:

- **Real agex code**: Complete framework capabilities and authentic examples
- **Pre-recorded LLM responses**: For reproducible results and fast viewing
- **Actual outputs**: See real DataFrames, plots, and agent execution events

!!! info "About the LLM Responses"
    The LLM responses in these demos are real outputs captured from actual model interactions, ensuring authentic examples while providing reproducible results.

## What You'll Learn

By exploring these notebooks, you'll understand:

1. **Why runtime interoperability matters** - See the difference between JSON tools and real object passing
2. **How to build multi-agent systems** - Learn orchestration patterns that scale
3. **How to debug agent behavior** - Use the events system for complete visibility
4. **When to choose agex** - Understand the framework's strengths and use cases
