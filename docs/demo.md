# Notebook Demos

Explore agex through complete, runnable examples that demonstrate core capabilities with real code, outputs, and explanations.

## Featured Demonstration

### ðŸš€ [agex 101: Your First AI Data Assistant](demos/agex101.ipynb)

A complete, hands-on walkthrough of `agex`'s core concepts:

- **Code-Native Workflow**: See an agent use `pandas` and `plotly` directly.
- **Live Object Passing**: Watch the agent receive and return real `DataFrame` objects.
- **Agent Observability**: Learn how to inspect the agent's thought process with `on_event` handlers.
- **Zero-to-Insight**: Go from a raw, messy dataset to a final plot in a single notebook.

## About These Demos

These demonstrations use:

- **Real agex code**: Complete framework capabilities and authentic examples
- **Pre-recorded LLM responses**: For reproducible results and fast viewing
- **Actual outputs**: See real DataFrames, plots, and agent execution events

!!! info "About the LLM Responses"
    The LLM responses in these demos are real outputs captured from actual model interactions, ensuring authentic examples while providing reproducible results.

## What You'll Learn

By exploring these notebooks, you'll understand:

1. **Why runtime interoperability matters** - See the difference between JSON tools and real object passing
2. **How to build multi-agent systems** - Learn orchestration patterns that scale
3. **How to debug agent behavior** - Use the events system for complete visibility
4. **When to choose agex** - Understand the framework's strengths and use cases
