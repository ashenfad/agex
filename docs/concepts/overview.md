# Concepts

High-level ideas that guide agex’s design and usage.

- [The Big Picture](big-picture.md) - Agents that think in code, curated micro‑DSLs, and sandbox philosophy.
- [Security](security.md) - Walled‑garden security model, AST validation, safe introspection.
- [Nearly Python](nearly-python.md) - The Python subset available to agents — what works, what’s different.
- [A Note on MCP](agex-and-mcp.md) - Why agex focuses on code‑native integration vs. tool schemas.

Use this section to understand why agex is built the way it is, and which constraints enable safe, powerful runtime interoperability.
