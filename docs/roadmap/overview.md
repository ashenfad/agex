# Roadmap

Short, high-signal summaries of planned capabilities with links to detailed items.

|   Topic   | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
|  [Contextual Primers](primers.md) ([#1](https://github.com/ashenfad/agex/issues/1)) | Auto-assemble small guidance snippets based on registered capabilities; inject only when relevant. |
| [System Token Counting](token_counting.md) ([#2](https://github.com/ashenfad/agex/issues/2)) | Estimate system context tokens (primer/framework/visibility) before calls; per-tokenizer breakdowns. |
| [MIME Bundles for Events](mime_bundles.md) ([#3](https://github.com/ashenfad/agex/issues/3)) | JSON-safe event serialization with MIME bundles for rich outputs; ready for UIs and observability. |
| [Local Agent Registries](local_registries.md) ([#4](https://github.com/ashenfad/agex/issues/4)) | Persist symbolic recipes so dynamically created agents can be reconstructed across process restarts. |
| [Faded Memory](faded_memory.md) ([#5](https://github.com/ashenfad/agex/issues/5)) | Deterministic context decay with re-rendering from Versioned state and on-demand detail refresh. |
