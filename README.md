# agex

`agex` (a portmanteau of **age**nt **ex**ecution) is a Python-native agentic framework that enables AI agents to think, act, and create using real Python code. It provides a secure, sandboxed execution environment that allows for deep interoperability with your existing codebase, moving beyond simple tool-calling to true runtime integration.

## 30-Second Example

```python
import math
from typing import Callable
from agex import Agent

agent = Agent()
agent.module(math)  # Give the agent math tools

@agent.task
def make_function(description: str) -> Callable:  # type: ignore[return-value]
    """Generate a Python function from a text description."""
    pass  # Empty body - the agent implements this function

# Agent returns an actual Python callable you can use immediately
prime_finder = make_function("find the next prime larger than a given number")

print(prime_finder(100))  # 101
my_data.sort(key=prime_finder)  # Works with existing Python code
```

**This works because** `agex` provides true runtime interoperability - agents don't just return JSON, they create real Python objects that live directly in your runtime environment.

**Which enables** seamless data flow between agents (numpy arrays, pandas DataFrames), hierarchical agent orchestration through normal Python control flow, and dynamic code generation that integrates immediately with existing systems.

## What Makes This Different

`agex` enables workflows that require significantly more complexity in frameworks that rely on JSON or isolated execution environments. The key difference is **runtime interoperability** - `agex` transparently handles the passing of complex Python objects between your code and an agent's sandboxed environment, working with rich objects like `numpy` arrays, `pandas` DataFrames, and custom classes without extra work.

This runtime interoperability enables several capabilities that are difficult elsewhere:

### **Dynamic Code Generation & Extension**

Agents can generate and return executable Python functions and classes at runtime. This allows them to not just use tools, but to create them.

In [`examples/funcy.py`](./examples/funcy.py), an agent is tasked with building a `Callable` function from a text prompt. The returned function is a real Python fn that can be immediately integrated into existing logic (e.g., `my_list.sort(key=agent_made_func)`).

### **Agent Orchestration**

`agex` is designed for building complex systems out of specialized agents. One agent's core `task` can be exposed as a simple `fn` (tool) for another agent, enabling natural and powerful composition.

Examples of multi-agent patterns:

- **[`examples/multi.py`](./examples/multi.py)**: An `orchestrator` agent delegates data generation and plotting tasks to specialist sub-agents to solve high-level visualization ideas
- **[`examples/evaluator_optimizer.py`](./examples/evaluator_optimizer.py)**: Iterative improvement through agent collaboration, where one agent creates content and another critiques it until quality criteria are metâ€”all orchestrated with a simple Python `while` loop

All orchestration is done with simple Python control flowâ€”no YAML or complex DSLs required.

### **Live Object Integration**

Agents can work directly with complex, stateful APIs without requiring wrapper classes or simplified interfaces. `agex` exposes live Python objectsâ€”including unpickleable ones like database connectionsâ€”while maintaining state serialization safety.

[`examples/db.py`](./examples/db.py) showcases this with raw SQLite integration: agents work directly with `sqlite3.Connection` and `Cursor` objects, handling complex method chaining (`db.execute().fetchall()`) and transaction management. No `DatabaseManager` wrapper neededâ€”agents adapt to the existing API.

### **Granular Function Execution**

While many agent frameworks use the term "tool", `agex` deliberately uses **`fn`** to signify a more fundamental concept.

*   **Tools** often imply high-level, stateless operations where inputs and outputs are easily serialized to JSON. This model is practical for workflows where an LLM reasons between each action.
*   An `agex` **`fn`** can be much more granular. Because agents think in code, they can compose many low-level function calls into a complete program within a single execution step. This allows for complex and efficient problem-solving without the latency and cost of an LLM call at every step.

This distinction is key to enabling agents that don't just *use* tools, but truly *program* with them.

### **Recursive Agent Creation**

Agents that can create other agents at runtime. This enables truly recursive AI systems where specialist agents can be born on-demand.

```python
architect = Agent(name="architect", primer=PRIMER)
architect.cls(Agent)  # Let the architect use agex!

@architect.task  
def create_specialist(prompt: str) -> Callable:
    """Make a new specialist agent given the prompt & return the task fn."""
    pass

# Agent creates another agent that creates working code
math_solver = create_specialist("solve mathematical equations step by step")
result = math_solver("4x + 5 = 13")  # "Therefore, x = 2.0"
```

**Why this matters:** Most frameworks can have agents *use* tools - `agex` agents can *architect* intelligence, creating new agents with their own capabilities and reasoning patterns. The utility of this is very much unproven but it is intriguing.

See [`examples/dogfood.py`](./examples/dogfood.py) for the complete implementation of agents creating agents.

## Project Status

`agex` is a new framework in active development. While the core concepts are stabilizing, the API should be considered experimental and is subject to change.

For teams looking for a more battle-tested library built on the same "agents-that-think-in-code" philosophy, we highly recommend Hugging Face's excellent [`smolagents`](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents) project. `agex` explores a different architectural path centered on a secure-by-design execution environment and deep runtime interoperability.

## Setup

This project uses `pyenv` to manage the Python version and `uv` for package management.

1.  **Set up the Python version:**
    If you have `pyenv` installed, it will automatically pick up the version from the `.python-version` file.

2.  **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    uv venv
    uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
    ```

3.  **Set up pre-commit hooks:**
    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    ```
